# Alfred Home Server
**_UNDER CONSTRUCTION_**

## Summary
Project Alfred is a home monitoring server intended to be run on the Raspberry Pi.
It is designed to be flexible and allow users to add various input/output devices, 
such as doorbells, garage doors, electrical outlets, ceiling fans, lights, etc, 
throughout the home to be monitored and/or controlled by Alfred.

# WARNING
Connecting high voltage electrical devices to the Raspberry Pi is no joke. You need to know what you're doing. There are plenty of good tutorials (and even more bad tutorials) on the internet showing how to connect devices. Please proceed with caution and at your own risk
